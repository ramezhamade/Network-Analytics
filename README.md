Overview
Over recent decades, it has been a growing interest of scientists to analyse the flow of information in complicated social networks. The concept of ‘Community Detection’ has been studied to identify certain groups that exist within such networks. This can be used to solve important business or managerial issues such as organisational silos or security in email networks. Therefore, the members of group 7 have conducted a study on use cases of 5 different algorithms and tested their characteristics on a Star Wars data set to help solve organisational silos. This will be contrasted with the Robustness Test created by the group to comment on the differences of each algorithm.
