Overview
Over recent decades, it has been a growing interest of scientists to analyse the flow of information in complicated social networks. The concept of ‘Community Detection’ has been studied to identify certain groups that exist within such networks. This can be used to solve important business or managerial issues such as organisational silos or security in email networks. 

# Algorithms Used
Girvan-Newman (GN),
Louvain Method (LM),
Fast Greedy Modularity (FGM),
Clique Percolation Method (CPM)

# Dataset: Arxiv GR-QC
This dataset is an unweighted collaboration network from the e-print arXiv and covers scientific collaborations between authors of the papers submitted to the General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology category. The graph is undirected and creates an edge from i to j, if an author i co-authored a paper with author j.

The data covers papers in the period from January 1993 to April 2003 (124 months). It begins within a few months of the inception of the arXiv, and thus represents essentially the complete history of its GR-QC sect
